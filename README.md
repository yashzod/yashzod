Hi, I’m Yash Zod, a Software Engineer with over 3 years of experience in backend development.
I specialize in Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, and building scalable APIs. I’ve also worked with machine learning, data processing, and web scraping to develop practical solutions.

At one of India’s leading audio OTT platforms, I was responsible for end-to-end backend development across content management and streaming systems. I focus on writing secure, efficient code, resolving critical issues, and collaborating with teams to deliver impactful features.

I’m always open to connecting with fellow engineers, learning from others, and exploring new opportunities.
